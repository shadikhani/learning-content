# Vaadin Learning Center content

This is the repository for the source content used on vaadin.com. Below are some instructions on authoring.

Also see `TEMPLATE.adoc` for a content template

## Contribution and branches

When contributing, please keep your branch naming as follows:
`author/author-name/tutorial-name`

When you are ready to get the content added, make a pull request to the `development` branch.

There is an automated contribution script `create.sh` that can create the branches and proper file structure for you with the following prerequisites:
- Unix/Linux environment
- No pending git changes and clean git status
- Visual Studio Code as an editor:

        If you are not using VSCode, you will get an error while attempting to run it.
        You can ignore the error and use your preferred editor.

To use the script, follow these instructions:

1. Create a new `profile` file based on the `profile.example` file:

```sh
cp profile.example profile
```

2. Modify the `profile` file in your home directory with your details, e.g.:

```sh
fullname="A.Mahdy Abdelaziz"
id=f484d2b8-7747-40c0-8a81-461808f32786
github=amahdy
```

3. Make `create.sh` executable

```sh
$ chmod +x create.sh
```

4. Run the script

```sh
$ ./create.sh
```

5. When asked for the new content name, enter a proper title for the content. It is used for the branch name, content title, and eventually the content URL on the website. So, make sure to provide a good title with proper format, e.g. `Intro to String Theory and Black Holes`.

6. If everything is ok, `Code` opens and the file where you should start writing your content `content.adoc` gets highlighted. Please note that you still have to update the `topics` value in `article.properties` file.

7. When you have done writing your content, push it to Github for review. You should be on the proper branch already.

## Definitions

### Article

An article encapsulates a set of sections and provides general meta data like the author and an introduction or teaser. If an article only has one section it is called a flat or simple article.

Meta data source: article.properties or in the content.adoc for flat articles.

### Topics

A topic is a special form of a tag with additional meta data. Articles must have one or more of the defined topics.

Meta data source: topics.json

| Property    | Definition                      | Source                                                                                  |

## URL mapping

The default is to map the filesystem path directly to the URLs. That means articles available via `content-base/<article-id>` in the file system are available via vaadin.com/content-base/<article-id>.

## Content format

_All content should be authored in AsciiDoc_. AsciiDoc provides its own way to define meta data:

```
= Creating a LitElement project

:title: Creating a LitElement project
:authors: marcus
:type: text, video
```

## Folder structure examples

This overview tries to sum up possible folder structures with flat/full articles.

```
    ├── <article>
    │   ├── article.properties (mandatory)
    │   ├── teaser.adoc (optional)
    │   ├── 01__<section name>
    │   │   ├── images
    │   │   │   └── blubb.png
    │   │   └── content.adoc (mandatory, asciidoc contains section properties already)
    │   ├── 02__<section name>
    │   │   ├── images
    │   │   │   └── moep.png
    │   │   ├── content.adoc (mandatory)
    │   │   └── section.properties (mandatory)

## Sub Pages

/tutorials maps tutorial series and tutorials to articles, and article sections.

## FAQ

**1. What is the author id? Where should we add it, the article itself or the article.properties file?**

The author ID (UUID, LR screen name or email address of the author) is used to resolve the author in the DB to get the real name and portrait. Everything defined in the article.properties file is the default for the whole article but can always be overwritten by section properties. As an UUID please take the existing ID from the source of the vaadin.com team page.

**2. Where is the teaser shown? How long should it be?**

Depends on the sub page. The idea of a teaser is to attract people to read the article. For blog posts a teaser is displayed in the list view. For tutorials it makes sense to display it in the tutorial series view.

**3. Could we define ordering of a series through a properties file instead of by folder name? In case I would for instance want to add a tutorial between number 2 or 3. This way the URLs wouldn't break**

The URLs will not break as the order is not part of it. Putting it into the content files will hide them away and you will likely duplicate numbers or forget some (both will not break the page but might result in random ordering).

**4. What are the required attributes? Which ones are supported?**

Necessary attributes are in content.adoc (title, authors, type, topic, tags, description) and in article.properties (title, author,
author_id, topics). Valid values for the "topic[s]" attribute can be found in topics.json and for the "tags" attribute in allowed_tags.lst. How to get the UUI is described in FAQ #1.  

Check definitions of articles and sections above.

**5. What should the folder structure be for single articles?**

Check the folder example above.

**6. Checklist for publishing an article?
