This section describes how to implement custom ResourceBundles for internationalization (I18N) in Vaadin Flow.


== Download base project
This tutorial uses the `flow-helloworld-maven-meecrowave`
as a base. Read more about it https://vaadin.com/tutorials/helloworld-with-meecrowave[here]

You are able to find the latest version of the source code for this tutorial
https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/flow-i18n-resourcebundles[@github]

== Recommended reading

It is recommended to read the tutorial about the https://vaadin.com/tutorials/i18n/i18nprovider[I18NProvider] first.
This tutorial will use the *I18NProvider* later for the translations.

== ResourceBundles
As mentioned in the previous parts of this tutorial series, we need a ResourceBundle
for every locale we want to support at runtime. The basic implementation of the ResourceBundle isinside the abstract class called *ResourceBundle* To use this we have three ways we can go.

=== PropertyResourceBundle
The most used version is the implementation that is using properties files. Here we are ready to go after we created the needed properties files.
How to do this is explained well in the first tutorial and the JavaDoc of the class.
But the key point is, that the properties files must be available inside the classpath.
Sometimes this is not what you need

=== ListResourceBundle
The abstract implementation of the ResouceBundle we are talking about is
located in the class *ListResourceBundle*. Here we get an abstract implementation
that will provide the properties for a dedicated Locale. We have to implement the
method `protected Object[][] getContents()`.

For every Locale we want to support at runtime, we need one corresponding implementation.
In practice, it looks like the following.

[source,java]
----
public class VaadinAppResource extends ListResourceBundle {
  @Override
  protected Object[][] getContents() {
    return new Object[][]{
        {"s1" , "value 01"} ,
        {"s2" , "value 02"}
    };
  }
}
----

This implementation we saw above we will use as default resource.
To get now an English and a German variation, we have to implement two more classes.


[source,java]
----
public class VaadinAppResource_de extends ListResourceBundle {

  @Override
  protected Object[][] getContents() {
    return new Object[][]{
        {"s1" , "value 01 - de"} ,
        {"s2" , "value 02 - de"}
    };
  }
}

public class VaadinAppResource_en extends ListResourceBundle {

  @Override
  protected Object[][] getContents() {
    return new Object[][]{
        {"s1" , "value 01 - en"} ,
        {"s2" , "value 02 - en"}
    };
  }
}
----

The name of the classes must follow the same rules, we have for properties files.

But how to use this?
The usage of this ResourceBundle is based on the fully qualified name of the main class, in our case the class*VaadinAppResource*. With this classname and the requested locale the static method *getBundle* from the class ResourceBundle will give you the instance of the custom ResourceBundle.

`ResourceBundle.getBundle(VaadinAppResource.class.getName(), Locale.ENGLISH )`

One thing, that may not be used regularly, is the usage of the default locale.
To get the default ResouceBundle the locale *ROOT* must be used.


[source,java]
----
public class VaadinAppResourceTest {

  @Test
  @DisplayName("Locale English")
  void test001() {
    final ResourceBundle a = ResourceBundle.getBundle(VaadinAppResource.class.getName(), Locale.ENGLISH );
    Assertions.assertEquals("value 01 - en", a.getString("s1"));
  }

  @Test
  @DisplayName("Locale German")
  void test002() {
    final ResourceBundle a = ResourceBundle.getBundle(VaadinAppResource.class.getName(), Locale.GERMAN );
    Assertions.assertEquals("value 01 - de", a.getString("s1"));
  }

  @Test
  @DisplayName("Locale Default")
  void test003() {
    final ResourceBundle a = ResourceBundle.getBundle(VaadinAppResource.class.getName() , Locale.ROOT);
    Assertions.assertEquals("value 01" , a.getString("s1"));
  }
}
----


=== Custom ResourceBundle
The previous two ways are provided by the JDK itself. But the third way you can go is based on the implementation of the abstract class ResouceBundle itself. By the way, there is no interface ResouceBundlethat can be used.

The abstract class ResouceBundle has two methods to implement.

* `protected Object handleGetObject(String key)`
* `public Enumeration<String> getKeys()`

Let's start with the method *handleGetObject*. As you can see here, the ResourceBundle
is not limited to Strings. This mechanism can be used for every output type,
but we are using it here only for translations. The method is the translation itself.
To stay as simple as possible, the implementation in this example will be based on a ConcurrentHashMaps a key/value store. But have in mind, at this point you can do whatever is needed.
For example, here you can consume external services or connect to a persistence storage or...

Back to our simple key/value storage, the implementation of this method is a delegator to the method *get* from the Map itself.  .

[source,java]
----
public class VaadinResourceBundle extends ResourceBundle {

  private  Map<String, String> values = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

  @Override
  protected Object handleGetObject(String key) {
    return values.get(key);
  }
}
----

The next method to implement is providing an enumeration of all available keys. Here again,
we are using the internal map, or better the key set of this map.


[source,java]
----
public class VaadinResourceBundle extends ResourceBundle {

  private  Map<String, String> values = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

  @Override
  protected Object handleGetObject(String key) {
    return values.get(key);
  }

  @Override
  public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
    return Collections.enumeration(values.keySet());
  }
}
----

Sure, these implementations are depending on the storage that will be used. But the logic
is straight forward. The more interesting thing is, how to get the instance of this ResourceBundle based on a requested locale? Have in mind, that the basic mechanism needs one instance for
one locale. Here we are at a point, that we have to make technical decisions that are fitting to the project that should use this implementation.For this example, I decided to use a static factory method. Maybe in your project, you want to do
it via ServiceLocator, dependency injection or something different.

The static factory method will give me the requested locale that should be used for the created instance.Here you can start with different strategies, how to deal with requested locales that are not supported,or specialized locales for different variations of a language.

One other big topic is caching and lazy loading strategies if the ResouceBundle is expensive.
Here we are not dealing with all of this, it is straight forward an init of the instance.

[source,java]
----
public class VaadinResourceBundle extends ResourceBundle {


  private  Map<String, String> values = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

  // the technical decision on how to create a variant for a Locale
  public static ResourceBundle forLocale(Locale locale) {

    final VaadinResourceBundle resourceBundle = new VaadinResourceBundle();
    if (locale.equals(Locale.GERMAN)) {
      resourceBundle.values.put("btn.click-me" , "dr√ºck mich");
    }

    if (locale.equals(Locale.ENGLISH)) {
      resourceBundle.values.put("btn.click-me" , "click me");
    }
    return resourceBundle;
  }

  @Override
  protected Object handleGetObject(String key) {
    return values.get(key);
  }

  @Override
  public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
    return Collections.enumeration(values.keySet());
  }
}
----

The usage of this will be inside the *I18NProvider* implementation.

[source,java]
----
  private static final ResourceBundle RESOURCE_BUNDLE_EN = VaadinResourceBundle.forLocale(ENGLISH);
  private static final ResourceBundle RESOURCE_BUNDLE_DE = VaadinResourceBundle.forLocale(GERMAN);

With this information, you are able to start implementing your custom ResourceBundle.
The topic is way bigger as it was handled here. But several related topics you can find
as separate tutorials.
