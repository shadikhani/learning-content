This part of the tutorial shows you how to implement a reusable form to edit data.

So far, all UI coding has been in one class, `MainView`. However, you can also use object oriented composition to create reusable UI components. A customer form is a perfect candidate to demonstrate using reusable UI components in Vaadin Flow.

== Adding Input Fields and Buttons

. Start by creating a new class in IntelliJ IDEA:

** Right-click the *com.vaadin.example* package and select *New > Java Class*.

** In the *Name* field, type `CustomerForm`, and click *OK*.

. To make this class a Vaadin UI component, you need to extend an existing component. Extend the `FormLayout` component as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public class CustomerForm extends FormLayout {
}
----

. The form needs an input field for each editable property in the `Customer` class. Vaadin Flow provides different kinds of fields for editing different kinds of values. We use the `TextField`, `ComboBox`, and `DatePicker` components. Define the following instance variables in the `CustomerForm` class:
+
[source,java]
----
private TextField firstName = new TextField("First name");
private TextField lastName = new TextField("Last name");
private ComboBox<CustomerStatus> status = new ComboBox<>("Status");
private DatePicker birthDate = new DatePicker("Birthdate");
----

. The form also needs two buttons to save and delete `Customer` instances. Add the buttons to the `CustomerForm` class as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
private Button save = new Button("Save");
private Button delete = new Button("Delete");
----

. With the components in place, you can set further configurations and add them to the form in a constructor. Add the following constructor to the `CustomerForm` class:
+
[source,java]
----
public CustomerForm() {
    status.setItems(CustomerStatus.values()); 

    HorizontalLayout buttons = new HorizontalLayout(save, delete);
    save.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY); 
    add(firstName, lastName, status, birthDate, buttons);
}
----
* `status.setItems` adds all the enum values as options to the `ComboBox`.

* `addThemeVariants` makes the save button prominent by decorating it with a style name.

== Showing and Hiding the Form

It should be possible to show the corresponding data from a specific `Customer` instance in the form, and to hide the form when necessary. 

. To display specific customer data in the form, you need to connect the properties of a given `Customer` instance to the input fields in the form. This is known as data binding, and Vaadin Flow provides the `Binder` helper class for this purpose. To bind the data, add the following instance variable to the `CustomerForm` class and initialize it in the constructor as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
private Binder<Customer> binder = new Binder<>(Customer.class);

public CustomerForm() {
    ...

    binder.bindInstanceFields(this);
}
----

* The `bindInstanceFields(this)` method processes all the instance variables that are input fields (for example, `TextField` and `ComboBox`) and maps them (matching by name) to the Java properties in the `Customer` class. For example, `Customer::firstName` is mapped to the `CustomerForm::firstName` input field. 
* You can override automatic mapping using the `@PropertyId` annotation in the `CustomerForm` input fields to explicitly declare the corresponding `Customer` instance variables.

. You can implement the logic to show or hide the form in a single public method. To do so, add the following code to `CustomerForm`:
+
[source,java]
----
public void setCustomer(Customer customer) {
    binder.setBean(customer); 

    if (customer == null) { 
        setVisible(false);
    } else { 
        setVisible(true);
        firstName.focus();
    }
}
----
* `setBean` connects the values in the `customer` object to the corresponding input fields of the form. When the user changes the value of an input field, the value is set in the corresponding instance variable of the `customer` object.

* When the `customer` is:
** `null`, the form is hidden. 
** is not `null`, the form is shown, and keyboard focus is placed on the *First name* input field to allow immediate typing.

== Implementing the Save and Delete Actions

. To ensure the save and the delete actions update the list of customers in the `MainView` class, we need to add a reference to this class. You can receive it in the constructor as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
private MainView mainView;

public CustomerForm(MainView mainView) {
    this.mainView = mainView;

    ...
}
----

. The save and the delete actions also need to reference the `CustomerService` class. Add a reference in the `CustomerForm` class as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
private CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
----

. With the `service` and `mainView` variables in place, implement the save action as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public CustomerForm(MainView mainView) {
    ...

    save.addClickListener(event -> save());
}

...

private void save() {
    Customer customer = binder.getBean(); 
    service.save(customer); 
    mainView.updateList(); 
    setCustomer(null); 
}
----
* `getBean` gets the `customer` instance that was bound to the input fields of the form.

* `service.save(customer)` performs the save action in the backend.

* `updateList` updates the list of customers in the main view.

* `setCustomer(null)` hides the form.

. Similarly, implement the delete action as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public CustomerForm(MainView mainView) {
    ...
    delete.addClickListener(event -> delete());
}

...

private void delete() {
    Customer customer = binder.getBean();
    service.delete(customer);
    mainView.updateList();
    setCustomer(null);
}
----

[NOTE] 
In a real-world project, you should introduce an interface to avoid coupling with the `MainView` class. Alternatively, you could use an event system, like CDI events, to completely decouple the components. To keep things simple, we left this out of the scope of this tutorial.

== Adding the Form to the Main View

. To add the form to the main view, add the form as an instance variable in the `MainView` class:
+
[source, java]
----
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    ...
    private CustomerForm form = new CustomerForm(this);

    ...
}
----

. To display the form to the right of the `Grid`, in the `MainView` class introduce a `HorizontalLayout` to wrap the `grid` and the `customerForm` components. Replace the `add(filterText, grid)` line of code with the following:
+
[source,java]
----
HorizontalLayout mainContent = new HorizontalLayout(grid, form);
mainContent.setSizeFull();
grid.setSizeFull();

add(filterText, mainContent);
----

. Compile the project, by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA, and refresh your browser to see the changes:
+

[NOTE]
The *Save* and *Delete* buttons don't work at this point, we'll add this in the next part of the tutorial.
